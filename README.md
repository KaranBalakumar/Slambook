# Visual Odometry and VisualSLAM basics in C++
This repository contains basics and implementations required for Visual Odometry and VisualSLAM. This repository contains,
- Very Basic C++ and CMake examples.
- Implementation of ```Eigen3``` template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms.
- Simple 3D Trajectory plotter using ```Eigen3``` and ```Pangolin```.
- Display camera's Rotation matrix, Euler Angles, Translation vector and Quaternion visualizer.
- Intro to OpenCV and mapping point clouds from stereo and RGBD camera images.
